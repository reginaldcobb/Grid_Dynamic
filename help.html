    <p>The objective of the Grid game is to have adjecent cells add to the Target value.</p>

    <p> When a new game is started, the players will click on a cell to insert the "Number to Play" into that cell. </p>

    <p>If adjacent cells or cell in the same row or column or diagional to the clicked cell add to the Target value, then target value is added to the player's total
        and the cells that contributed are block and made unavailable. The current cell is not blocked.</p>
